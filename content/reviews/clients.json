      "text": "I know Vrezh since 2017 when he joined an internship program at Armenian Code Academy(ACA), where he was the best student in a group of 20 which we formed out of 1000 applicants. Despite that the course was on front-end development, Vrezh implemented a strong backend architecture using Node.JS during his final project. \n After gaining experience in the industry, in 2019 Vrezh started tutoring at ACA as a teaching assistant, conducting seminars, and doing code review for both complete newbies and students with some experience in JavaScript. The satisfaction level of students was among the highest, and currently, we have allocated a full JS Course to Vrezh (both seminars and lectures). \n I’m very excited to work with Vrezh both as a professional and as a friend. His devotion to project, company and values are among the highest I’ve ever met!",

      "text": "Our company has been working on a complex multimedia web project that required a lot of effort, required constant changes and coordination, and non-conventional solutions “beyond the box”. Besides, we had to do all this in a short period of time. \n We were lucky to have Vrezh as our partner. He is competent, always delves into the problem, and suggests solutions. He is responsive, friendly, and calm. He was always willing to accept the necessary changes, thoughtfully implemented them without engaging into lengthy discussions. Vrezh managed to make this difficult process stress-free and concentrated on the output. It was impressive and simply great. \nThank you, Vrezh!",
