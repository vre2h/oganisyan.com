      "text": "Our company has been working on a complex multimedia web project that required a lot of effort, required constant changes and coordination, and non-conventional solutions “beyond the box”. Besides, we had to do all this in a short period of time. \n We were lucky to have Vrezh as our partner. He is competent, always delves into the problem, and suggests solutions. He is responsive, friendly, and calm. He was always willing to accept the necessary changes, thoughtfully implemented them without engaging into lengthy discussions. Vrezh managed to make this difficult process stress-free and concentrated on the output. It was impressive and simply great. \nThank you, Vrezh!",
