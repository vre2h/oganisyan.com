So almost always I needed to work hard after the class to be okay with the material. I spend a lot of nights trying to cope with the topics by reading different articles (in parallel I was blaming myself for not being so smart ü§ü).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/97a96/preview.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 45.94594594594595%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAJCAYAAAAywQxIAAAACXBIWXMAACE4AAAhOAFFljFgAAAAx0lEQVQoz+2QSwuCQBSF/X2FimGi+RtbtOldmzKoRWSYkWQ+axVBRG2iOc2YiasM2rb4OIfLmcs9w2Gn4WdcjbyV+y/MIK6a6WOrZpr3ib48SfOfL0xCHvV7HQhrQEyJKEGqYUqsE/hJvuBCuuxmK5g1ygjGEpZtHpuBiMO0gnVfRGhI8EYSzCZPjnMZdGlx5bujwmzx8OlDqyPA7gmIJhVYXQHOUMSKqlEvETZD8E1l5uNcZQatd7EUnBYyzssqriuFsCbsD594azqL+T815AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"preview\"\n        title=\"preview\"\n        src=\"/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/fcda8/preview.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/12f09/preview.png 148w,\n/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/e4a3f/preview.png 295w,\n/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/fcda8/preview.png 590w,\n/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/efc66/preview.png 885w,\n/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/c83ae/preview.png 1180w,\n/static/5a315dd2474bcd0ce703a8aaff6bf25b/97a96/preview.png 2400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>All these difficulties make me realize that I need to explore how the system called the brain learns and interprets materials. After some sleepless nights I get acquired with the ideas of spaced repetition, chunking, and the illusion of competence that I covered in the previous article<sup><a href=\"#additional-literature-\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>This researches brought me to the idea that we should understand the way that our brain works instead of blaming ourselves. Some might argue that there‚Äôre a lot of people who‚Äôre learning faster and smoother than another, but for this time let‚Äôs not dig that deeper and just accept that if you‚Äôre not that kind of a person, you should continue to read instead of self-blaming and seeking the ways to become next genius.</p>\n<p>The understanding of the basics of neuroscience gives me patterns on how to work so at the time I started teaching programming and I was able to notice that most of my students facing the same issues as me. So I decided to come up with applicable idea/analog that might help them to understand and start learning instead of self-devouring. Yet another sleepless nights presented me ‚Äúthe rule of 20 links‚Äù.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Rule of 20 Link‚Äù says that understanding of the topic taking a study of around 15-20 links and resources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only thing that I ask is just to try to find and work with those 20 links after the session of self-devouring. Below you can find my table based vision of working with those links.</p>\n<p><em>Note, the number of links you need to achieve the same level may vary depends on your previous skills but on average it takes 20 links/resources.</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stages of mastering¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</th>\n<th>Knowledge</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Link¬† 0 - 1</td>\n<td>Getting familiar with the topic: (in the best case understanding the main concepts)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link¬† 1 - 6</td>\n<td>Solving template problems tasks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link¬† 6 - 10</td>\n<td>Solving applicable tasks and basic vision of big picture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link¬† 10 - 15</td>\n<td>Acquiring with the underlying ideas and why‚Äôs.
