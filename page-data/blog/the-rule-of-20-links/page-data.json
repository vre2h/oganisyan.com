So almost always I needed to work hard after the class to be okay with the material. I spend a lot of nights trying to cope with the topics by reading different articles (in parallel I was blaming myself for not being so smart 🤟).</p>\n<p>All these difficulties make me realize that I need to explore how the system called the brain learns and interprets materials. After some sleepless nights I get acquired with the ideas of spaced repetition, chunking, and the illusion of competence that I covered in the previous article<sup><a href=\"#additional-literature-\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>This researches brought me to the idea that we should understand the way that our brain works instead of blaming ourselves. Some might argue that there’re a lot of people who’re learning faster and smoother than another, but for this time let’s not dig that deeper and just accept that if you’re not that kind of a person, you should continue to read instead of self-blaming and seeking the ways to become next genius.</p>\n<p>The understanding of the basics of neuroscience gives me patterns on how to work so at the time I started teaching programming and I was able to notice that most of my students facing the same issues as me. So I decided to come up with applicable idea/analog that might help them to understand and start learning instead of self-devouring. Yet another sleepless nights presented me “the rule of 20 links”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Rule of 20 Link” says that understanding of the topic taking a study of around 15-20 links and resources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only thing that I ask is just to try to find and work with those 20 links after the session of self-devouring. Below you can find my table based vision of working with those links.</p>\n<p><em>Note, the number of links you need to achieve the same level may vary depends on your previous skills but on average it takes 20 links/resources.</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stages of mastering       </th>\n<th>Knowledge</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Link  0 - 1</td>\n<td>Getting familiar with the topic: (in the best case understanding the main concepts)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link  1 - 6</td>\n<td>Solving template problems tasks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link  6 - 10</td>\n<td>Solving applicable tasks and basic vision of big picture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link  10 - 15</td>\n<td>Acquiring with the underlying ideas and why’s.
